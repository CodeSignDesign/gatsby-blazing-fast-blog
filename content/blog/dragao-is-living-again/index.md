##Dragao is just going better and better... 
***"I have evolute my old ways!", he says, "Every time I felt, I stood up, and I counted how many times I got up. I was fighting. For me I was in war, all the time, days and nights, continuously. That's different now! I do not have to fall to learn something, all I have to do is to accept it and go on in peace and grace. There's no need to fight, no need for enemy, no internally and no externally. I am in peace with myself and with others."***

All I have to do is: 
1. Understand that it is possible to fail in something, but if we fail, we will learn from that and it make us more experienced to succeed.
2. We have the experience of failure and now is the time to not make same mistake but to go through to success.
3. We repeat the steps of success and it becomes habit. It is the habit to be successful and do the right moves. Do not judge yourself, just go on with good attitude!
